Is cross browser testing necessary?":[{"title":"Is cross browser testing necessary?","content":"\nDifferent browsers and operating systems have different ways of handling code. The smallest errors, like forgetting a semicolon or not closing a tag, may behave differently in different environments. Some browsers may render the component easily, while others may throw errors or not show anything at all. This can be pointed out with the help of cross-browser testing. Cross-browser testing is also necessary for example in javascript code we have a new feature but old browsers don't support it. this can be also figured out while testing.\n","section":"11.

Why do we use unit testing?":[{"title":"Why do we use unit testing?","content":"\nUnit test provide a way to test small units of code independently of the larger system. This is useful to check that an application is meeting its requirements, and to ensure that the code is working as expected.\n\n**Benefits of unit testing:**\n\n 1. It is a good way to test small units of code independently of the larger system.\n 2. Increases code readability.\n 3. improve deployment velocity.\n\n**Examples of Init testing in JS:**\n\n```javascript\nconst sum = (a, b) => a + b;\ndescribe('sum', () => {\n  it('should add two numbers', () => {\n    expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);\n  });\n}\n```\n","section":"12.
